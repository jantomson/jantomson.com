      <h2>Nature's Secret</h2>
      <p class="blog_post">
        Humans have gone off the natural track long ago. Cats always land on
        their feet and assess the risk perfectly, no matter what.
        <br />
        <br />
        Have you ever wondered why animals always do things perfectly and why
        humans fail at every doorstep?
        <br />
        <br />
        Humans are so foreign in the nature, people have become to prefer
        plastic flowers over the natural flowers.
        <br />
        <br />
        We have become so artificial, not just in the physical, but also in
        everything inside, more so because of the electronics.
        <br />
        <br />
        Do you know why it has become so? It has become so because at some point
        of human evolution, the ego has taken control over human lives.
        <br />
        <br />
        That is why everything has become business. That is why millions of
        people in every industry remain average and don’t make the leap to
        becoming the number one. That is why humans are relentlessly affected by
        anxiety. And this is the way for 99.9% of people from the day their
        inner child dies to the day they die.
        <br />
        <br />
        But still there are a handful of people, who from their childhood have
        been different in their ways, these are the ones who know that there is
        something more to life, something which society can’t offer.
        <br />
        <br />
        These people are the ones who care most for the ultimate peace, and with
        constant exposure to truth it will become available to them. Once they
        have found their way out and transcended the mind, everything will be
        crystal clear.
        <br />
        <br />
        They will be the Buddhas. They will be the Einstein’s in their field.
        They will be the ones behind the real human progress. They will embody
        the perfect human as the Nature first created it to be. They will act
        perfectly in every situation just like cats always landing on their
        feet.
